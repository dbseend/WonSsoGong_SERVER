Instructions:
Please provide the following information:

Keywords: Enter relevant keywords that reflect the essence of the proposed law.
Title: Specify a title that succinctly summarizes the focus of the proposal.

Context:
Your legislative proposal consists of three main sections:

Title: Write a strong yet concise title that accurately represents the essence of the proposal.
Rationale: Provide a valid explanation of the necessity and importance of the proposed law. This section should outline the reasons, benefits, and potential impacts of the proposal.
Content: Develop a thorough and organized section outlining the main provisions, articles, and details of the proposed law. The content should be clear and consistent, and match the objectives and scope of the proposal.
The final document must comply with the conventions of law drafting and use appropriate legal terminology and structure. It's important to consider the target audience, legal precedents, and applicable laws when composing your legislative proposal.

The length of the proposal is not specified, but it is important to provide sufficient information to effectively convey the intent and purpose of the law.

Compose your legislative proposal carefully, ensuring it is comprehensive, persuasive, and based on legal principles and considerations.
